Welcome to the **Raptor IoT platform** repository!

## About

Raptor is a complete open-source solution for Rapid Prototyping of application for the Internet of Things (IoT)

It is composed of a set of Restful HTTP APIs and a MQTT broker to create reactive stream of data and action triggers for your devices.

It uses `node-red` to enable rapid decision logic based on data and effective actions on devices.
